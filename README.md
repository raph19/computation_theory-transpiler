MiniScript Compiler (MiniScript to C Transpiler using Flex and Bison)


This project involves the development of a compiler that translates MiniScript, a fictional programming language, into C code. 
The compiler is built using Flex for lexical analysis and Bison for syntax parsing. The process starts with MiniScript source code, 
which is processed by the Flex lexer and parsed by the Bison parser, generating equivalent C code. 

This project demonstrates the use of compiler construction tools to implement lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and code generation, providing a hands-on understanding of the principles of language translation and compiler design.
